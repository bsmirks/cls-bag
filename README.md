# My CLS bag

This repository intends to document the contents and use of my personal TC3 v2 bag. Additionally, I will include terminology/acronym definitions. The information contained here is not intended to replace proper CLS/EMT/medical training, and is only a collection of information regarding *my* trauma bag.
Besides that, I intend to implement different documentation practices in order to develop myself professionally.
