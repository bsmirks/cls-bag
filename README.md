# My CLS bag

This repository intends to document the contents and use of my personal TC3 v2 bag. Additionally, I will include terminology/acronym definitions. The information contained here is not intended to replace proper CLS/EMT/medical training, and is only a collection of information regarding *my* trauma bag.
Besides that, I intend to implement different documentation practices in order to develop myself professionally.

## Terminology

This section is a list of acronyms, terms, and definitions as it relates to the information in this repository. However, if the term used in later sections is descriptive as-is, it will not be included here.

- Malice clip - Used to attach modular pouches to MOLLE/PALS style equipment.
- 8 hook - An 8 hook is a hook shaped knife that is used to cut materials in an emergency, such as seatbelts.
- CLS - Combat Life Saver. A title given to someone who has been certified through the military CLS course.
- EMT - Emergency Medical Technician.
- Muslin bandage - A triangular shaped cloth that can be used for many purposes such as a sling, makeshift tourniquet, etc.
- NPA - Nasopharyngeal airway. A rubber tube that is inserted into the nostril to provide an airway if the situation requires it.
- SAM Splint - A tough, flexible splint. SAM is not an acronym, rather, it is the company that provides it.
- TC3 - Tactical Combat Casualty Care bag
- Trauma shears - A scissor-like tool used to cut clothing in an emergency.

## Inventory

From here on, there will be a section for each pocket of the bag, what's in the pocket, and a basic overview of how to use said item.

### Outside velcro pocket

The outside velcro pocket is, as the name suggests, closed with velcro, and on the outermost area of the bag. As an added measure for keeping items within secure, there is a single button on the top left corner of the pocket.

The following items are contained in this pocket:

- Malice clip, (1)
- 8 hook, (1)

With just these two, no instructions will be included as it either does not pertain to medical treatment or is self explanitory.

### Outside zipper pocket

The outside zipper pocket is the second largest pocket, located between the outside velcro pocket and the largest zipper pocket.

The following items are contained in this pocket:

- Examination gloves, pair, (4)
  - Generally when dealing with a patient, it is always adviseable to wear gloves. This minimizes the chance of introducing germs and the like. Obviously not required if time is of the essence.
- Trauma shears, (1)
  - If dealing with an injury beneath clothing, you should use these to cut the clothing away in order to properly treat the wound, especially if removing the clothing by hand could cause further injury.

### Large zipper pocket

The large zipper pocket is the furthest away from the velcro pocket and contains the most items.

The following items are contained in this pocket:

- Tourniquet (TQ), (2)
- Trauma wound dressing, (2)
